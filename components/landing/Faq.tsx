    question: "Who is Stride for?",
    answer:
      "Stride is built for individuals and indie hackers who want to get things done instead of wasting time on complicated tools. If you're building something solo or with a small team, and you want a simple, fast way to manage tasks without all the bloat, Stride is for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Stride free?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Stride is completely free and open source. You can also self-host it on your own server.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a team to use it?",
    answer:
      "Nope. While Stride supports teams, it works great for solo projects too. Create your workspace, add projects, and start managing tasks. Invite others later if you want.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data safe?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Stride uses secure authentication and you can self-host it to keep your data on your own server. The code is open source, so you can verify everything yourself.",
